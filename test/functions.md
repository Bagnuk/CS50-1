## Questions

1. You have many checks and operations when you could just us a bitwise operator to change
    the required bits.

2. You'll quickly run out of space

3. There is no need for the original jpeg, since each hash is unique you can just hash
    the results from the students code and compare them to the hashed key images.

4. It's O(1) for each letter. so a 7 letter word would take 8 steps.  7 for the
    letters and one for the end of word indentifier. If the hash table is not ordered then
    you could potentially have to look at each element of the array.
