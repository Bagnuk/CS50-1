## Questions

1. n is expecting a float value.  Check that all value in operation are of same type.

2.      get_string is not formatted correctly see below for an example.
       string s = get_string("Enter string: ");

3. It apears you are trying to compare a hex value.  C is interperating as an actual hex value.
    Do you mean to compare two strings?

4. Without seeing the rest of the code I can't make a detemrination of what might be happening.
